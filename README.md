Database-Security
=================

SQL Injections Documentation and Examples AKA The Bobby Tables Project

++Introduction
Database Security is something almost every computer scientist needs to worry about because databases are used so vastly in computer science today. This project will aim towards exposing these threats on specifically MySQL Databases and then preceed by fixing said vulnerablities one at a time. We've divded this project up into 4 sections, each section focuses on different kinds of SQL Injection attacks and tries to document each step of the way to both breaking into the database and then fixing it.

This project came to be after I found a serious lack of easily approachable Database Security Documentation and Examples online. This project tries to combat that lack.

Each section contains interactive examples so the reader can apply what he learned on a real-world example immedietly. These examples have been collected from numerous hacking contests like Reykjavik University Hacking Contest and PicoCTF. All the documentation to these examples are done solely by us the authors of The Bobby Tables Project

++Disclaimer
This project is meant as a demonstration for educational purposes ONLY and should thus never be abused in a real-world setting. The Technical College of Iceland is in no way responsible for this project and does NOT condone breaking into databases in any shape or form.

++Examples
++++Injection 1
the first section and serves as an introduction to SQL injections and demonstrates the most common form of SQL based attacks
++++Injection 2
This second section goes a little deeper into SQL Injection and requires to analyze the target database and it's tables
++++Injection 3
This section will demonstrate the wrong way to escape user input
++++Injection 4
This section will demonstrate how you can not only bypass a login system but how to extract a user's password through SQL queries
